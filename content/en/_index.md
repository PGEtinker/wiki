## What is PGEtinker

PGEtinker is an interactive online application which allows it's users to write
olc::PixelGameEngine applications inside a web browser, without the need to install
and use a compiler/toolchain on your local machine.

## What is it used for?

PGEtinker can be used for a many things. The primary purpose of PGEtinker is to
make C++ programming more accessible to learners but it can be used by experienced
programmers who want to quickly test an idea in code or perhaps during travel when
you're away from your development environment, PGEtinker has been tested on laptops,
chromebooks, and even works well enough on mobile devices for those wanting to
program on the go.


## Whos's responsible for this monstrosity?

PGEtinker is the brain child of

(the creator of the olc::PixelGameEngine)
and the OneLoneCoder community in general. Individuals who have made significant
