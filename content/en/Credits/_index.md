I just want to take a moment to acknowledge several amazing projects and people,
without whom PGEtinker would not exist, or at least not be as awesome as it is
today.

## olc::PixelGameEngine

[olc::PixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine) is a
single-file, cross-platform graphics and user input framework used for games,
visualizations, algorithm exploration, and learning. It was developed by [YouTuber
"javidx9"](https://youtube.com/@javidx9) as an assistive tool for many of his
videos. The PixelGameEngine, or PGE, as many in the OneLoneCoder community call it,
is PGEtinker's namesake. PGE is amazing! Thank
you Javid.

## Compiler Explorer

[Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org) is an interactive tool that lets you
type code in one window and see the results of its compilation in another window.
It is the brainchild of [Matt Godbolt](https://xania.org/MattGodbolt). His wonderful
tool was, for a very long time, the yardstick by which I measured my progress. I even
use some of the same libraries he uses in his project! While PGEtinker would have
existed regardless, I suspect it wouldn't have much of its polished experience
without being able to learn from Compiler Explorer as an example. PGEtinker
does quite alot differently, but you can definitely see where Compiler Explorer
had a heavy influence on the way PGEtinker presents itself. I felt it would be
inappropriate not to thank Matt for his work on Compiler Explorer.

# Emscripten

[Emscripten](https://emscripten.org) is a complete compiler toolchain to
WebAssembly, using LLVM, with a special focus on speed, size, and the web
platform. This is the glue that brings the PixelGameEngine to the web and
allows PGEtinker to be possible at all. Thanks to the
[authors](https://emscripten.org/docs/contributing/AUTHORS.html#emscripten-authors)
of Emscripten.
